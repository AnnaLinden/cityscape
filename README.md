# Animated City Skyline

This project is an animated portrayal of a city skyline during the day and night using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It initially started as a FreeCodeCamp assignment, and I extended it by adding an animated starry sky using JavaScript.

## Daytime Skyline

During the day, the skyline uses bright colors to represent a sunny day. Below is a screenshot of what the skyline looks like during the day.

## Nighttime Skyline

When the screen width is less than 1000px, the skyline transitions into a night scene, complete with an animated starry sky. Each star is represented by a small div with a blinking animation, and the stars are randomly distributed across the sky.

## Responsive Design

The city skyline is fully responsive. When the window is resized, the starry sky is repainted to fit the new window dimensions, ensuring that the whole sky is always filled with stars.

## CSS Variables

The project uses CSS variables for color values. This makes it easy to change the color scheme of the entire skyline by simply changing a few variables. The color variables are set differently for daytime and nighttime to achieve the desired color effects for each time of day.

## Tech Stack

The city buildings are created using HTML div elements and styled using CSS. The stars are created using JavaScript. They are randomly positioned on load, and their positions are updated whenever the window is resized to ensure the whole sky is always filled with stars.
